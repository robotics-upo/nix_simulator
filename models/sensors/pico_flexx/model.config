    A model of the pico flexx depth camera using gpu laser.
    Note: with the sdf format we can only put one instance in ROS without duplicating topics, tfs, etc.
          for that reason, I have included in the installation script, called by the CMakeLists.txt a
          part for making copies of the pico_flexx sensor.
